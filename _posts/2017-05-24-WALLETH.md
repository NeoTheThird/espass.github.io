title: Update and BuildingBlocks
---
It was a bit quite here - but this is not because the project is stalled.
In contrast: BuildingBlocks are being build!
Tickets are mobile - you rarely see people showing their tickets on their PC. In fact I have only seen this at CCC events so far ;-)
This means we need light clients to really decentralize this space and not just have the blockchain as one expensive database. So focus is currently on the development of <a href="http://walleth.org">WALLETH</a>.

When WALLETH is ready - then esPass will integrate with it. Even though light-clients sound light - they are just lighter than normal clients. In a mobile context they are still pretty heavy. This is why WALLETH is a separate project and the BlockChain functionality is not directly included in <a href="http://github.com/ligi/PassAndroid">PassAndroid</a>.
One of the reasons for this update is as I am seeing more and more projects popping up in this space and I want to prevent resources from being wasted. I made a list of all projects in this space I know of <a href="/links">here.</a>
